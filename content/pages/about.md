### Hi, I’m Tegar Nugroho

I’m a Flutter developer focused on building accessible, high‑performance applications.

I favor clean architecture and maintainable code so every product feels smooth, consistent, and easy to evolve.

I’ve shipped mobile, web, and desktop projects with a strong emphasis on performance, consistency, and scalability.

At Wolkk (remote), I build cross‑platform solutions that combine clear design with robust engineering.
